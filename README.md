# Updated Introduction
The self-help genre, often met with both skepticism and enthusiastic adoption, has become an integral part of contemporary culture. Many individuals may not readily identify as “self-help readers,” yet a closer look at popular authors such as Brené Brown, Malcolm Gladwell, or Jordan Peterson—as well as widely read titles like Atomic Habits and Thinking, Fast and Slow—reveals that the pursuit of self-improvement permeates our reading choices. This widespread interest, whether through books that delve into meditation, investment strategy, spirituality, or even the biochemical underpinnings of stress, reflects a collective desire to better understand and manage the complexities of modern life.

I, too, have immersed myself in this literary landscape, exploring works like The Untethered Soul and The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k, in attempts to navigate my very big feelings. My personal journey through self-help literature has been characterized by numerous false starts and moments of fleeting resolve, each experiment with habit change and dietary adjustment underscoring both the appeal and the inherent challenges of self-improvement. 

This reflective experience underscores a broader societal trend: despite the lingering stigma around self-help, millions continue to seek guidance in the hope of achieving a more disciplined, purposeful existence.

Historically, self-help emerged during a period of significant social and economic transformation. Samuel Smiles, often hailed as the father of self-help, published his seminal work (literally titled) Self Help in 1859, inspired by Benjamin Franklin’s maxim, “Heaven helps those that help themselves.” During the industrial revolution, when many faced the hardships of factory work, exploitation, and dwindling social mobility, Smiles’ advocacy for hard work, thrift, and personal responsibility resonated deeply with a society in search of agency. This early incarnation of self-help was inherently linked to external socio-economic challenges—a stark contrast to the internalized focus seen in much of today’s literature.

In the modern era, self-help literature predominantly shifts the locus of responsibility inward, suggesting that the causes and solutions to our problems lie within ourselves rather than in external circumstances. Contemporary narratives often posit a dualistic model in which an individual is divided between a problematic self and a capable self tasked with effecting change. This internal focus can inadvertently foster a culture of self-blame, where the pressures to conform to idealized standards of “should” and “enough” further complicate the pursuit of personal growth. Such a perspective contrasts sharply with the historical context of self-help, where external hardships were the primary catalysts for personal advancement.

This thesis seeks to explore two central questions: 

1. How do world events and external factors influence the issues addressed by self-help literature over time? 
2. Can we map the expansive landscape of self-help in a way that helps readers identify where their personal challenges align within the genre, and determine which titles offer the most credible guidance?

This study is underpinned by a proprietary dataset that combines tens of thousands of Goodreads titles with zero-shot classification and natural language analysis to answer the above. The data includes how many people read, want to read, or are currently reading the title. It includes data that covers pricing, the author's qualifications for giving advice, the methodological rigor of the research, the complexity of the content, and the tone and intended outcomes of the works. 

This study aims to contextualize self-help within both its historical roots and its modern manifestations. Ultimately, this exploration endeavors to reframe the conversation around self-help—highlighting the interplay between external forces and internal struggles, and challenging the stigma that often shadows the genre.

# (Rough) Introduction
Origin Story
In 2020, I did it: I found enlightenment. I was cosplaying as a regular guy, but secretly, I was an unordained monk—a seer of truths, a manifester of oneness.


All because I read a book.


It was called Untethered Soul. Its cover featured a stallion running free on a beach. Never mind this rogue, presumably lost steed; I saw that horse and thought, “Yes. That. I want that.”
I still remember the first time I opened Untethered Soul. “Chapter 1: The Voice Inside Your Head.” I—and my very loud, very critical inner roommate—were sold. I hung on to every word. Even after I finished, I kept the book close by, revisiting passages in biblical fashion.


At its core, this book offers a Western take on some Eastern ideas, particularly “objective consciousness.” It goes something like this: • You feel pain when you step on a Lego. • You feel sorrow when your pet dies. • You hear a voice in your head that says, “Nope, not good enough.” If you can feel, hear, or perceive something, then you did not cause it—you are the subject, and something else is the object.


It clicked: I wasn’t failing at life; life was just happening. What was once all-consuming anxiety became a character on a metaphorical TV screen, experiencing anxiety instead of me.
Untethered Soul is, of course, a self-help book. It markets itself as a spiritual guide or a take on Buddhist philosophy, but at its root—like all self-help—it aims to enable you to solve your problems. You have problems, and you have the power to solve them, whether through belief in God, the Universe, or sheer willpower.


Wake up depressed? Objective consciousness says, “You didn’t choose this—let it go.” Trouble in your relationship? Tell your partner five things you love about them every day. Maybe journal about it. Is your CFO at odds with your CTO? A book about radical transparency will get the C-suite back on track (and profits up!).


Brace yourself for a bombshell: I am not enlightened. I have been unable to simply accept what happens to me. With nearly every problem, I feel it’s my responsibility to solve it. Since reading Untethered Soul, I’ve tried two fitness trackers, counted calories, attempted daily meditation, tried out veganism, failed at veganism, doubled therapy sessions, read books like The Power of Habit and The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***, met with nutritionists, psychiatrists, and one man who claimed to be both, and even went on a spirit quest to the Smoky Mountains.


By now, you might sense the kind of person I am: spiritual, not religious; emotional, not stoic; granola, not boot-strappy; determined to make me better even if it takes 1,000 false starts.
My brand of self-help—the habits I adopt and, more importantly, the books I read—is different from others. But all of self-help publishing began with one man.
A Brief History of Self-Help
The father of self-help is Samuel Smiles. His book—fittingly titled Self Help—was published in 1859 and led with a maxim borrowed from Benjamin Franklin: “Heaven helps those that help themselves.” In Smiles’ day, many had moved from farms to factories, where they found themselves diseased and exploited. The rich grew richer while social mobility for the working class was nearly impossible. It makes sense, then, that the Protestant values of hard work, thrift, and personal responsibility seemed virtuous when investment in society was failing.


Roughly 166 years later, we’ve gone from one such book to more than 60,000. Advice columns have multiplied into millions of YouTube videos and clickable articles promising that you can vitamin-supplement, ab-crunch, and astral-project your way from dependence on anything to self-actualization. Tony Robbins is a household name and mental health is dinner conversation. How to Win Friends and Influence People line mantles and Brené Brown is mother.


At its heart, self-help hinges on the premise that you can transform and improve through self-guided effort. New York Magazine’s article The Self in Self-Help claims an ancient “dualistic model” is at the center of all self-help: within you, there is both a problematic self and a capable self, the latter tasked with fixing the former. Put another way, self-help often casts difficulties by “invoking an immortal soul and a moral sinner.” The same philosophy is used in 12-step programs.
Forces Beyond the “Self”
As described in Makeover Culture in American Life, the “belabored self” reflects a modern condition where individuals feel pressure to constantly work on and improve themselves. Doing anything “constantly” breeds fatigue, which explains my cycle of self-improvement attempts, failures, and new beginnings.


Amid the millions of articles and tens of thousands of books, a small slice targets people like me. The self-help I pursue differs from anyone else’s. By the numbers, few Americans seek self-help exactly as I do, while the rest explore energy healing, entrepreneurial greatness, Jesus Christ, and much more.


But my pursuit of self-improvement isn’t dictated solely by my interests and beliefs. Despite the belabored self’s insistence that “everything is your fault,” there are external forces at play.
Recall Samuel Smiles’ and the beginning of the self-help genre. A tension arises. During the Industrial Revolution and, in the U.S., on the eve of the Civil War, the “sinful” or problematic force was society, not the self. At some point, we began blaming ourselves for forces outside our control. Books rooted in economics, race, and policy argue that systems are to blame. Yet, 40 million self-help books were sold in 2023 in the U.S. alone.
Thesis & Looking Forward
My thesis is simple: self-help reflects what ails humanity, and the ways we handle our ailments are unique. The long-form instruction manuals on how to “better” ourselves are growing more specialized even as the self-help publishing industry produces more titles than ever.
Using datasets and models from Goodreads, Wikipedia, and Hugging Face—supplemented by scholarly research—I explore how self-help narratives evolve in response to historical, cultural, and technological changes, and how these shifts intersect with personal journeys. I aim to illustrate how evolving narratives connect to individual experiences and where readers fit in this universe of self-help, self-awareness, and self-forgiveness in the face of external forces. Finally, I consider the future. As more content becomes personalized, especially through artificial intelligence, I will examine how self-help might continue to evolve.


# Thesis Abstract
This thesis explores the evolution of self-help literature through the lens of data visualization, integrating insights from literary analysis and modern computational techniques. 

By examining the origins and historical shifts of the self-help genre, the study investigates how external societal events and internal narratives of self-improvement converge to shape the advice dispensed by authors. Utilizing the BART-large-lmni zero-shot model, Wikipedia entries, and a comprehensive Goodreads dataset of 60 million books, the research maps natural language trends and identifies key thematic shifts. Additionally, the work examines the credibility of authors, including the influence of celebrity voices, and questions the extent to which self-help addresses challenges imposed by external forces versus self-generated dilemmas.

Looking forward, the thesis also examines the potential transformation of self-help literature in an era dominated by AI and generative technologies. It considers how personalized, AI-generated content might revolutionize the creation of self-help materials—from bespoke titles and synopses to dynamic book covers—offering a fresh perspective on enduring literary practices. 

Ultimately, the study aims to provide a data-driven synthesis of the self-help genre, revealing insights into its enduring appeal and evolving landscape in response to both personal and societal demands.
